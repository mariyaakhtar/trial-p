              I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science Engineering in the
              2019 with a focus in OOP with Java, DSA and software engineering
              principles. My projects in various platforms have helped me in
              diversifying my skillset and I am eager to apply the knowledge and
              skills Iâ€™ve learned in an environment that would challenge me.{" "}

              I am extremely organized which makes me exceptionally particular
              about my projects. Apart from coding, my interests also lies in
              plants, sipping caffiene, travelling and the rain. A place with
              all the above is where you will find me!{" "}
